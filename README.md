# Journey-through-node.js
Noob learning his way through node.js

Edit1
In my initial research I found a few pain points:

1. What is node.js?
A: node.js is a runtime that executes code.  Code is essentially just a text file, so how does that text turn into commands, buttons, etc?  There is a program that knows how to read the code and then do something with it (commands, buttons, etc).  node.js is the program that reads the code and then does something with it. (I'm sure there is more to it, but this is will help basic users understand "what" node.js even is).  I think it's a library too.  Would make sense if it is ...
2. What and how do I install?
A: Some guides recommend installing through command line, while others say to use the Windows installer .exe (Each OS has different options)  I went with the .exe file directly from node website.  Make sure you install npm too, I believe it helps install additional modules (like expansions with prebuilt code ... think a package of legos that says "you can build a star wars xwing with these peices").  This will just install node.js, but then you still need a text editor (notepad++ etc) to write your code, and a terminal program (Windows cmd prompt, etc) to execute commands (you will tell node to run javascripts files and need a terminal for that ... you will understand later if you don't yet ... just make sure you have a terminal).
3. There are helloworld examples for your first node.js project (Dr. Google found me plenty) so I Would start there once you have everything installed.
4. I'm still fairly lost, so don't despair if you are too!
